1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction

A quick dive into SQL (Structured Query Language), explaining its purpose and importance in managing and querying relational databases.
Why I‚Äôm Learning SQL: My personal motivation and specific goals. (e.g., becoming proficient in data manipulation, improving backend skills, etc.)


2Ô∏è‚É£ Getting Started & Installation

Setting up my SQL environment: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite?

Clear steps on installation and initial configuration.

Links to official documentation for easy reference.


3Ô∏è‚É£ Creating Databases & Tables

Explanation of SQL commands like CREATE DATABASE and CREATE TABLE.

Examples of table creation with proper use of data types and constraints.

CREATE TABLE Books (
   id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
   title VARCHAR(100),
   author VARCHAR(50),
   published_year INT
);

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Inserting Data**

**Overview of INSERT INTO statements to populate tables with meaningful data**.

Examples of inserting multiple rows and handling different data types.

INSERT INTO Books (title, author, published_year)

VALUES ('SQL Mastery', 'John Doe', 2022);


5Ô∏è‚É£ **CRUD Basics**
Covering the core operations of SQL:
Create
Read
Update
Delete
Practical examples to demonstrate how each operation works.

6Ô∏è‚É£ **CRUD Challenge**
Challenge: Solving a practical problem using CRUD operations.
My Solution: Code snippets and an explanation of my thought process.

7Ô∏è‚É£ **String Functions**
Learning string manipulation with SQL functions such as:

CONCAT(): Combine multiple strings.

LENGTH(): Get the length of a string.

SUBSTRING(): Extract a part of a string.

UPPER()/LOWER(): Change case of text.

SELECT CONCAT(author_fname, ' ', author_lname) AS author_name FROM Books;

8Ô∏è‚É£ **Refining Selections**

Filtering data with WHERE, LIKE, and comparison operators.

Using logical operators to refine results further.

SELECT * FROM Books WHERE title LIKE 'SQL%';.


 **Aggregate Functions**
 
Mastering powerful SQL aggregate functions like:

COUNT(): Count the number of rows.

SUM(): Add numeric values.

AVG(): Calculate averages.

MIN()/MAX(): Get minimum or maximum values.

SELECT AVG(published_year) FROM Books;


üîü **Revisiting Data Types**

Recap of SQL data types:

Numeric: INT, FLOAT, DECIMAL

Character: VARCHAR, CHAR, TEXT

Date/Time: DATE, TIMESTAMP

Examples: When and how to use each type for optimal performance.


**Conclusion** üèÅ

This journey is just the beginning! With every query and operation, I‚Äôm becoming more confident in using SQL to work with data efficiently. Stay tuned for more updates and code as I dive deeper into advanced topics.
